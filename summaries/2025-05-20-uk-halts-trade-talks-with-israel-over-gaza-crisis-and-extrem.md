The UK has suspended trade negotiations with Israel amid condemnation of extremist rhetoric and humanitarian blockades in Gaza, calling Israel's actions immoral and counterproductive. British officials criticized Israel's plans for forced relocations and aid restrictions, while imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers and warning of Israel's growing international isolation. The UK emphasizes the urgent need for aid delivery and calls for an end to the blockade to prevent further humanitarian disaster.
