A mechanical failure, likely involving the ship's rudder losing power, caused the Mexican Navy training ship Cuauht√©moc to crash into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two crew deaths and multiple injuries. The ship lost control and drifted in the wrong direction due to currents before colliding with the bridge during a ceremonial tradition. Rescue efforts by NYPD, FDNY, and the Coast Guard evacuated the wounded, while investigations continue with the ship's voyage data recorder.
